Learn Solidity - Contract Oriented Language for Ethereum Smart contracts

There are terms unheard in following Document which freaks the hell out and its better to say Scary.
But the whole thing is sweetest pancakes Swetter you ever had. The whole concept is ragging the future of internet - Web3.0 branched on [Blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain). Blockchain was conceptualised in 2008 by an anonymous person or group known as Satoshi Nakamoto comes in light after its implementation in BitCoin

If you have no idea what Solidity or this is first time to heard name Ethereum or Contract or Some of you have an idea about Solidity how to learn this language. 
## Solidity 

Solidity is a statically typed, **contract programming language** that has similarities to Javascript and C++. Like objects in OOP, each contract contains state variables, functions, and common data types. Contract-specific features include modifier (guard) clauses, event notifiers for listeners, and custom global variables.

Solidity Language itself is a tool that we use to generate machine-level code that can execute on the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine), it’s a language with a compiler which takes our high-level human-readable code and breaks it down into simple instructions like “put data into a register”, “add data from two registers”, “jump back to instruction at memory point xxxxx”, which form the basis of any microprocessor executable program.

So the Solidity language is just one of several languages which can be compiled into EVM bytecode, another language that does the same thing is called Serpent. Each language might have several compiler tools but they all do the same thing, which is to generate EVM machine-level bytecode to be run on the Ethereum nodes, for payment.
