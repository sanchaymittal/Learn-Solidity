# EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine)

The Ethereum Virtual Machine focuses on providing security and executing untrusted code by computers all over the world. To be more specific, this project focuses on preventing Denial-of-service attacks, which have become somewhat common in the cryptocurrency world. Moreover, the EVM ensures programs do not have access to each otherâ€™s state, ensuring communication can be established without any potential interference.

To put this into a language everyone can understand, the Ethereum Virtual Machine is designed to serve as a runtime environment for smart contracts based on Ethereum. As most cryptocurrency enthusiasts are well aware of, smart contracts are very popular these days. This technology can be used to automatically conduct transactions or perform specific actions on the Ethereum blockchain. Many people predict smart contracts will help revolutionize finance and other industries over the coming years.
