### pragma

 - pragmas are instructions for the compiler about how to treat the source code 
 - In Solidity pragma is use to represent version used for Code.
 - This is important because this ensures that the contract does not suddenly behave differently with a new compiler version.
 
 
 
 ### public
 
  - This automatically generates a function that allows you to access the current value of the state variable.
  - Without this keyword, other contracts have no way to access to the variables introduced in contract.
